thanks for buying UltimateUHC
here some simple infomation of the plugin

backpack multi languages title will only works on the player's version higher then 1.8! (if the player's version is lower then 1.8 (ex. 1.7) , then the inventory title will be default language title only)

the plugin supported PlaceholderAPI

how do i update to version 1.0C ?:
  language.yml:
    added <backpack-title: '§6§l<teamName>§f§ls'' backpack'>
    added <schenarios.is-disable: '&cScenario &e<scenario> &cis currently disabled.'>
